This bot sends you an email with a word every day from your personalized list of words. 

Nowadays, there are multiple websites for subscription to receive an email with a word every day to improve your vocabulary.

In this article, we will go through the steps for creating a bot that will send you an English word every day from your personalized list of words.          
In this tutorial, I developed a bot that sends an email with a word every day from your personalized list of words. For this, I scraped a list of words from the web using the python libraries Selenium and Beautiful Soup. I used python's inbuilt smtplib library to send an email from our list of personalized words. Finally, I used windows task scheduler to run the python script every day that sends an email with a word.
